## Introduction
This analysis uses 2 months of anonymous data from a personal activity monitoring device. The device collects data at 5 minute intervals throughout the day. The data was collected during October and November, 2012. The analysis done here will be explained step by step, so you can reproduce it.

## Data
The data for this assignment was downloaded from the course web site:

* *Dataset*: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* *steps*: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)  

* *date*: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format  

* *interval*: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

### Load the set 
Download the data, unzip it, read the .csv file, and print the file name; we are assuming that the zip file contains only one .csv file.
